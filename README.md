# football-stats-direct

FootballStatsDirect is a React app I created for fun, publicly available at https://footballstatsdirect.com. It is hosted on Firebase. The main component of the app is AG Grid to display various statistics from the top 5 European leagues which are retrieved from an external API. I've also included the ability to view the data using AG Grid's own charting tools and various filter buttons to view different data such as different team/league/top scorers/most red cards etc.
